# Bird MVC
A quick PHP framework that utilises the MVC architectural pattern. 

PHP Requirements
- 'Compatible with PHP 7.0/1 '
- It will work with php version 5.3 and above, but I strongly
recommend upgrading to php 7.0 or 7.1.

# Why did I create this? 
Just to learn the low level architecture of how frameworks actually work and what better way to do it by creating my own.
